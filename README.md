🏥 Obesity Intelligence Platform
v2.0 - Enterprise Edition

A production-grade AI platform for Obesity Risk Assessment and Personalized Health Recommendations. This project uses an ensemble of advanced Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.) to provide accurate multiclass classification and regression analysis.

✨ New Features in v2.0
Multi-Model Intelligence: Automatically trains and selects the best model from Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
Dual-Prediction Engines:
Classification: Predicts Obesity Risk Level (7 Categories).
Regression: Estimates "Expected Weight" based on lifestyle to quantify health gaps.
Interactive Health Dashboard: A modern Streamlit UI with animated gauges, probability distributions, and risk meters.
Explainable AI (XAI): Integrated feature importance analysis to explain why a risk level was predicted.
Smart Recommendations: Hybrid Rule-ML engine providing actionable lifestyle advice.

� Quick Start
Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the Platform This determines the best models for your data and saves the artifacts.

python src/train_platform.py
Note: This script automatically handles cross-validation and selects between XGBoost, LightGBM, etc. based on availability.

Launch the Dashboard

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
